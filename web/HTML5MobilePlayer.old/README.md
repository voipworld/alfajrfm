# That Radio Player

That Radio Player is an HTML5 webapp that uses the `<audio>` tag to stream webradios on a mobile phone. It has been tested in Safari on iOS 4.3 and later. It is optimized for a mobile phone screen and especially for the iPhone and the iPod touch.

**Try That Radio Player on your iOS device:** http://romaindillet.github.com/That-Radio-Player/

This webapp is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No code is executed server-side.

Other devices such as Android devices (Android 2.3 and later) _could_ be able to stream webradios, but .PLS and .M3U file support is not guaranteed. You should first edit the radio presets to replace .PLS and .M3U links to direct links to the streaming servers.
